# Todo-Managment
The Todo-Management project is a comprehensive task management system built to offer seamless task tracking and management functionalities. Powered by the robust Spring Boot 3 framework, it ensures swift backend processing and secure user interactions, enhanced by the advanced features of Spring Security 6. To fortify security further, the application integrates JWT for token-based authentication, ensuring that data transmissions are not just swift, but also secure.

The backend harnesses the power of Spring Data JPA, making data persistence and retrieval operations efficient and straightforward. All data is securely stored in a MySQL database, ensuring data integrity and reliability. Development was streamlined using the IntelliJ IDEA environment, and Maven was used as the dependable build and dependency management tool.

For testing API endpoints and ensuring they function as expected, Postman Client was the tool of choice, offering an intuitive interface to simulate and test requests.

On the frontend, the application employs React.js (version 18+), guaranteeing a responsive and dynamic user interface. To expedite development while ensuring a modern and user-friendly design, Bootstrap CSS was incorporated. All frontend logic relies on JavaScript, and npm ensures the streamlined management of packages and dependencies. For efficient server-client communication, the application uses Axios, providing a promise-based architecture for asynchronous operations.

In summary, the Todo-Management project is a blend of cutting-edge technologies designed to provide users with a seamless task management experience, from backend operations to a user-friendly frontend interface
